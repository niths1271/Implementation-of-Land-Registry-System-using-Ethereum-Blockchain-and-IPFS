# Implementation of Land Registry System using Ethereum Blockchain and IPFS

A decentralized application is created, and its performance is assessed by evaluating costs and execution time. By leveraging the inherent qualities of blockchain, we aim to implement it within Indiaâ€™s Land Registration System, an area notorious for fraudulent activities. This integration results in a more advanced system that facilitates efficient and trustworthy transactions for activities such as buying and selling.

## Tech

We use a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [React JS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
- [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
- [Express] - fast node.js network app framework
- [Metamask] - Crypto Currency wallet for blockchain applications.
- [Truffle ] - Development framework for Ethereum
- [Ganache] - Used to create Ethereum development ecosystem to facilitate the development, testing, and deployment of smart contracts.
- [Solidity] - Programming language designed specifically for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain and other blockchain platforms.
- [Infura] - Infura for IPFS storage.


## Installation(Frontend)
Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
cd material-react-app
npm install
npm start
```

Note:
- The application by default will run at port 3000.
- Please make sure .env file is configured properly before running the application as it contains all
the details about ports,api token,secret keys etc.

## Installation(Backend)

Install Ganache in your environment which helps us to create a local blockchain network

```sh
cd blockchain
npm install
truffle compile 
truffle migrate
```
Note:
- By default 10 accounts will be provided in local blockchain network by ganache.
- Make sure metamask extension is installed in your browsers.
- Metamask wallet can be used to store the private keys of all blockchain accounts and sign all our
transactions.
- To add an account into metamask just get the private key of your account and access your account 
using that.
- Make sure your connected to the right blockchain network.
